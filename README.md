- Black Rose Immortal (First 5 minutes)
- When
- Ghost of Perdition
- The Lotus Eater
- Elden Ring Theme *(Test track I forgot in there, will be removed (or not) in the future)*

#### Planned additions (if I don't run out of cartridge space):

 - [x]  Eternal Rains will Come
 - [ ]  Advent
 - [x]  Deliverance
 - [ ]  Heart in Hand
 - [x]  Silhouette
 - [x]  For Absent Friends
 - [x]  In Mist she was Standing


*Some songs might be cut here and there to save some cartridge space (or my sanity while transcribing them)*


Currently the resource folders are all missing so unfortunately you can't build the ROM yourself :( 
I'll eventually upload everything once I'm mostly done with it
You can still find a working ROM in the Releases. 

**This ROM was tested and works on real hardware.**
